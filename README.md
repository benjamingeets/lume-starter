# Lume Starter

Lume starts very well alone. But I need a bit more stuff to deploy my websites. So here comes "Lume Starter"

Made for Apache servers.

- Use PHP files to replace Edge/serverless Functions (check `/_api/`)
- LightningCSS
- ESbuild
- Deploy using RSYNC
- .htaccess setup (404, compress, security, ...)
